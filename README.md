# Address Book using jQuery

This page allows the user to create contacts which can be added to their
'Address Book'. Diving further into closures with jQuery, the user can add multiple contacts and click through them showing one individual contact at a time.

For each contact created, the function will create a 'newContact' variable and save the input values for each of the input fields. It will then append this submission to a list and the newContact variable will be reset, waiting for the next contact to be submitted.

Once there are multiple contacts inputted into the Address_Book, you can click on them individually which will show the hidden field and display their

<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Address</li>

This page was aimed to help understand the use of closures and how powerful they can be, while still using relatively simple code.
